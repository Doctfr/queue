# queue #

A simple BungeeCord plugin that controls join rate of players to individual servers. 

### Adding a player to a queue ###
All servers defined in the BungeeCord instance have a queue that players can be added to programmatically. The plugin only enforces specific players joining the queue and does not override the behaviors of other plugins or commands such as `/server`.
 
Players can be added to a specific server queue through the Plugin Messaging Channel. The plugin registers and listens for commands on the `Queue` channel, so plugins must register the outgoing channel appropriately. 
  
The `Join` subchannel is used to add a player to a specific queue and takes the following arguments:
* Player UUID
* Target server

An example of a helper method to send a player to a queue is:
```java
/**
 * Connects a player to a servers queue.
 * 
 * @param player Player to connect
 * @param target Queue to join
 */
public void joinServerQueue(Player player, String target) {
    ByteArrayDataOutput out = ByteStreams.newDataOutput();
    out.writeUTF("Join");
    out.writeUTF(player.getUniqueId().toString());
    out.writeUTF(target);
    player.sendPluginMessage(this, "Queue", out.toByteArray());
}
```
